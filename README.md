# UP2 Heat Pipe Bender
A jig to bend a 
[6mm x 150mm heat pipe](https://www.europeanthermodynamics.com/products/heat-pipes/heat-pipes-sintered/heat-pipe-150mm-x-6mm-sf-06-150-s)
for the
[UP2 fanless aluminum case](https://up-shop.org/up-peripherals/142-up-squared-fanless-chassis-with-vesa-mounting-plate.html)
to better cool an
[AI Core mini-PCIe card](https://up-shop.org/featured/204-up-ai-core.html).

You also need a 50mm wide hand vise to compress the central part of the heat pipe down to 2.2mm so it can be jammed
between the fins of the AI Core's heat sink, and compress the remainder of the heat pipe down to 4.3mm wide to
give it a more appropriate bend radius.
This design is meant to be 3D printed but also uses four bearings (8mm OD, 4mm ID, flange optional) and a pair of 
M4 x 14 bolts and a pair of M4 nuts (locking type preferred).
